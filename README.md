Responsive Portfolio

This assignment required a reconfiguration of our original Portfolio pages to incorporate CSS Bootstrap and responsive design elements.

This Responsive Portfolio site includes an "About" page, a "Contact" page, and a "Portfolio" page. All pages have been reformatted with Bootstrap components and all integrate responsive pictures and elements that format correctly no matter the size of the screen being viewed on.
